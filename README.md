## User Story
AS A local car buyer or seller
I WANT to be able to list and buy cars
SO THAT I can easily and securely make purchases, or sell vechicles that I own.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an application to buy or sell a car
WHEN I login or create an account
THEN I can see local cars listed. The ones for sale will be noted as such.

WHEN I click on a vehicle
THEN I can see an expanded view of the car and description 
WHEN I login or create an account
THEN I see if the car listed is for sale.

WHEN I click on a vehicle
THEN I can see the name and email of the seller
WHEN I click on the compare button
THEN I can compare several vehicles side by side
WHEN I buy a vehicle
THEN I can go back and see a list of my vehicles.
